\chapter{Conclusion} \label{chap:conclusion}

In this paper, we came up with an efficient algorithm KNN Join for the
spark distributed framework. We have used voronoi based partitioning
method to partition both the dataset R and S and effectively pruning
the unnecessary partition for every vector based on the distance to
the farthest neighbour within the same partition. This reduces the
total number of distance computation and hence reducing the total runtime.
we also exploited parallel processing in spark by parallelizing
computation for KNN in each partition. With various experiments we
have also shown that our algorithm has faster run time, memory and
network bandwidth efficient, scalable to very large datasets and
highly parallelizable.
