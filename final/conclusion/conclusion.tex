In this paper, we came up with an efficient algorithm KNN Join for the
distributed framework, spark. By partitioning both the dataset R and S
using voronoi based methods and finding nearest neighbour within the
same partition as only points on the edge of the partition will have
nearest neighbour in other partition. we exploited parallel processing
in spark by parallelizing computation done in each partition. The
results taken in real datasets proves that the algorithm is efficient
in both network and i/o usage and scalable.
