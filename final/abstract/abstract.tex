\chapter*{Abstract}
KNN Join is a simple but effective Machine Learning algorithm. It is
one of the top 10 machine learning algorithm. The algorithm does not
scale well for large datasets due to its high computational
complexity. With the advent of cloud providers and falling cost of
on-demand computing resources, it would be prudent to design a
distributed algorithm with lower computational complexity, high
horizontal scalability and with better runtime.

Our thesis is about designing a distributed algorithm for Accurate
KNN Join problem with reduced computational complexity. We have chosen spark as our
distributed framework because of its in-memory primitives and its
suitability for iterative programming. Our algorithm is scalable to
very large datasets and is also horizontally scalable. With all the
optimizations, our algorithm can be more than 1000 times faster than
bruteforce for a dataset size of 12 Million vectors.
