\chapter{Introduction}


KNN (K Nearest Neighbour) Join is one of the simplest and elegant
classification or regression algorithm which works remarkably well in
practice. It is a non parametric lazy learning algorithm. It is
classified as one of the top 10 machine learning algorithm. KNN Join
has become an important primitive in datamining and
finds its application in multimedia data retrieval, Online
recommendation, DNA search,
Molecular Biology, bioinformatics  and
many other fields.

One major drawback of KNN Join with regards to performance is that the computational complexity is
very high. KNN Join, if run on a single node, with a
large training and test dataset, fails to provide results in reasonable amount of time, making it
unusable. This warrants the need for better algorithm with
reduced computational complexity and should be able to
leverage distributed frameworks like Hadoop \cite{hadoop_mr} or Spark
\cite{apache_spark} to run on datacenter scale machines in parallel.
Though there has been many works, they are mostly focussed on either creating
an efficient indexing techniques or efficient pruning for reducing
number of distance computation in a centralized environment.
Only one
research paper \cite{lu_efficient_2012} has been published so far in
designing the accurate algorithm
for Distributed framework. They chose to use Hadoop MapReduce as it
was the most dominant framework at that time.


In this paper we focus on
developing an accurate KNN Join algorithm for spark framework, which is
the current high performant distributed framework. Our goal in this
paper is to reduce the number of distance computations, improving running time,
scalability from single node to thousands of node, extensibility from
medium to large dataset
